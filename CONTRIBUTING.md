# Contributing to Kilo Scheduler

Kilo Scheduler is a simple app, but it was built from a Roo Code fork as the starter, so there's plenty of code to ignore.  Feel free to add any features or fixes you think would be useful.

You'll find the code for this extension primarily in:
- src/services/scheduler
- webview-ui/src/components/scheduler
