# Adapters Directory

Each adapter has a short profile with:
- Summary and supported actions
- Command IDs (trigger/list) we bind to
- Settings keys under `agent-scheduler.experimental.agents.<id>`
- Links to upstream documentation and code
- Status (Generic or Specialized)

Update these as we align on exact commands and APIs.
